**Abstract:** 
We present a hybrid cloud+campus model for deploying secure research cyberinfrastructure in line with a growing number of federally funded scientific research security requirements. While the security mechanisms are inline with many regulations, we specifically focus on the NIST 800-171 CUI compliance that is now required by many US DARPA funded contracts. We discuss our architectural framework and rationale for leveraging shared ND services in AWS GovCloud in concert with CUI compliant HPC systems on our campus in a hybrid fashion; allowing an individual CUI regulated research project to bridge two connected but distinct infrastructures.
