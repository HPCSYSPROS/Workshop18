# Overview

Here you will find in seperate folders the three artifacts that are used in our environments to help
create a CI process in which to test the configuration management code that we use to create our
stateless images. We include the tool we use to create the OS directories and include services 
needed to allow containers to be created from them.  

We also include a sample gitlab CI file that can be used to spawn the image containers on the Gitlab runner hosts, run the configuration 
management code on them, run compliance tests to verify the state of the image, and finally 
take the OS directory and create a CPIO based image that can then be distributed to the TFTP boot server
to finally boot nodes into the image via PXE.

Finally we include a rolling reboot script that can be used or adapted to provide a mechanism
to apply updates and reboot nodes into updated images without having to take downtime to apply 
updates to nodes.
