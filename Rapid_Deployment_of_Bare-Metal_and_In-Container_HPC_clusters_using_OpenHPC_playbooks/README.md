**Abstract:**
In this paper, we present a toolbox of reusable Ansible roles and playbooks in order to configure a cluster software environment described by the freely available OpenHPC recipes. They can be composed in order to deploy a robust and reliable cluster environment, instilled with the best practice offered by the OpenHPC packaging, and the repeatability and integrity guarantees of the configuration managed approach. With container virtualization setting a new trend in scientific software management, we focus this effort on supporting the deployment of such environments on both bare-metal and container-based targets.
